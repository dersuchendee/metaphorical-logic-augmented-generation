# A Logic Augmented Generation Approach to Enhance Multimodal Analogical Reasoning


This work introduces a Logic-Augmented Generation (LAG) framework that combines knowledge graphs with Conceptual Blending-inspired prompts to capture implicit analogies. Applied to metaphor detection tasks, it outperforms baselines, enhances explainability, and even exceeds human performance in understanding visual metaphors.

## Data

Data contains datasets and annotator responses.

## Code

Code contains prompts and code templates for LAG-based metaphorical processing.

## Ontology

The framework is built upon the Conceptual Blending Ontology which provides a formal representation of metaphorical and conceptual blending processes. This ontology is crucial for understanding how the LAG framework operates:

## Code

Code contains the code template for visual and image prompting.
